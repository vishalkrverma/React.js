React.js is a JavaScript Library used for building user interfaces (UIs) and single page applications.
Created by Jordan Walke at facebook.
It was first used in facebook in NEWS FEED section.
React knows only one things that is user inteface..

REACT IS ALL ABOUT THE COMPONENTS.
It is used to make reduce the number of line of code and increases the code reusability.

------------ WHY REACT.js ----------------------------------------------------------

React is declarative beacuse it describes what the UI should look like rather than how tp achieve it.
This makes the code easier to read and maintain, as it more focused on the end result rather than the steps involved in getting here.

-----------------  Example of Declarative -----------------------------------------------

function Mycomponent({name}){
return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;
}

----------------------  Example of Imperative ----------------------------------------
function MyComponent({name}){
const element= document.createElement('div'); // Create a new div element
element.textContext='Hello, ${name}!';   // Set text context manually
return element;      // Return the created element 
}

Here we manually creating elements,setting their property and appending them to the DOM.

--------------- PROJECTS STRUCTURE ------------------------------------------------
NODE MODULES:
       THIS IS THE FOLDER WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE NECCESSARY LIBRARIES AND DEPENDENCIES BY REACT.JS.
       YOU CAN IGNORE THIS FOLDER COMPLETELY.

PUBLIC:
       THIS FOLDER CONTAINS ALL STATIC FILES LIKES IMAGES,VIDEOS,FONT etc.
SRC:
    THIS FOLDER CONTAINS ALL SOURCE FILES (REACT COMPONENT,JAVASCRIPT FILES ,AND CSS).

    APP.JSX:
           THE MAIN REACT COMPONENT THAT ACTS AS HELPER COMPONENT.
    MAIN.JSX:
             THIS IS THE ENTRY POINT TO OUR REACT.JS 
    .ESLINTRC.CJS:
               THIS FILE INCLUDES CONGIGURATION FOR ESLint.
               ESLint IS A STATIC CODE ANALYSIS TOOL FOR IDENTIFYING PROBLEMATIC PATTERNS FOUND IN JS CODE..

    .GITIGNORE
PACKAGE.JSON:
            IT INCLUDES NAME,VERSION,DESCRIPTIONS,SCRIPTS DEPENDENCIES.

In Dependecies we will React and React-dom:
   React.js is just a library for creating dynamic user interfaces.
   React DOM is used to render those components on our web page.
   You might have heard about React Native for creating mobile applications which is also based on React.js.

   -----------------  NAMING CONVENTIONS ----------------------------------------
   CAMEL-CASES: CAPITALIZATION OF FIRST WORD EXCEPT THE FIRST IS DONE.
   PASCAL-CASE: CAPITALIZATION OF EACH WORD IS DONE.
   SNAKE-CASE:EACH WORD IS SEPERATED BT THE "_" AND IS IN SMALL LETTER.
   KEBAB-CASE: EACH WORD IS SEPERATED BY THE HYPEN "-".

   
   COMPONENT IS REACT FUNCTION WHICH RETURN THE JS CODE..

   ---------- JSX  --------------------------------------------------------------------
   JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and appendChild() methods.

   While a React.element is a building block and a part of the virtual dom.it is not the virtual DOM istself.
   Rather, it is an object within the virtua; DOM tree that describes what should be rendered on the screen. 

   BABEL is a javascript compiler.
   
   Each JSX expression must have one parent element,which means if you try to return multiple elements,
   React will throw an error.
   Every JSX tag needs to be closed.You can use self-closing tags for the elements that don't have children.
   These are also known as the Void Elements.

   ----------------------  OUR FIRST REACT.JS COMPONENT ------------------------------------------------------------

  In React,a component is essentially a JavaScript function or class that returns JSX(JavaScript XML),a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
  Components are the Building Blocks of any React application,allowing fir the creation of coplex and interactive user 
  interfaces through the assembly of isolated,reusable pieces.

  THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO CREATE COMPONENTS IN REACT.JS
  CLASS BASED COMPONENTS:
              This is how components were created before functional components.
   FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT:
              This is the modern and recommended ways of writing React.js components.
              Generally we use the functional components which are easy to implement and understandable.


-----------------------------  REACT FRAGMENTS --------------------------------------------
In React.js , a component can't return multiple elements without a wrapper div.
You can do this to imitate it. Using an array of elements with keys.
It allows  components to return multiple elements without adding extra node to the dom.

PROBLEMS:
       WHY CAN'T WE RETURN MULTIPLE ELEMENT AT THE SAME TIME ?
       As after JSX is compiled it is converted to normal JavaScript object,you can't return multiple JavaScript object at the same time.
